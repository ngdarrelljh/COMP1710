    <p><h1>About Me</h1></p>
    
        <h6><p>My name is Darrell Ng and I am a Singaporean exchange student from National University of Singapore! I am currently in my third year studying Industrial & Systems Engineering.</br>
        I enjoy gaming, reading and writing in my free time. I stay in an airbnb house in Gungahlin during my time here. I am enjoying the relaxing environment of Canberra and ANU, </br>
        and the people here are really friendly compared to back in Singapore. I am very pleased to see the amount of effort that ANU takes to help exchange students have a good stay here </br>
        and feel welcome. I have made many friends here and learnt a lot about Australia. I hope to be able to return for a visit in the future!

<p><h9>Mission Statement</h9></p>
<h8><p>The Grand Library is a website for me to give recommendations and reviews on books that I have read. All the books will be non-fiction, as those are the types that I read the most. </br>
        The genres that I usually read are fantasy, with elements of magic and supernatural stuff, and occasionally thriller and crime as well. </br>
    This website provides my opinions, thoughts and feelings on books, and I would also like to receive recommendations as well! Feel free to give your own recommendations, </br></h8>
<h10>and I am also open to having a discussion as well. I might also including original short stories for critique, if time permits, as writing is also a hobby of mine that I do sporadically.
    </p></h10>

    <h7><p>Goals</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To give good book recommendations that others would enjoy</li>
        <li>To write book reviews based on my personal opinion</li>
        <li>To improve in my own writing skills</li>
    </ul></h7>
