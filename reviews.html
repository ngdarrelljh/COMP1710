    <h4>Read this series when I was 16 and still a heavy reader. I initially bought Fire on a whim and only realised it was part 2 in a 3-part series after finishing it.<br>
           Loved Fire a lot, and searched for Graceling, the first part, for months before finally finding it in a bookstore at a shopping mall. The story takes place in a <br>
           world where some people are born with a special ability, known as a Grace, which is not exactly a superpower but rather an extreme skill or sixth sense, <br>
           for instance having the ability to be an extremely good chef, or mastering archery, or mind-reading. People with a Grace, or Gracelings, are identified by their<br>
           heterochromia, and are respected and invited to work for the King. Fire has a rather standalone plot, while Bitterblue is actually the sequel to Graceling despite <br>
           being the third released book. For Fire, I felt that it had a good blend of adventure and thrill with a slight romantic subplot. Very well-paced and I particularly <br>
           enjoyed the plot twists that had extremely good set-up and foreshadowing that you only realise at the climax of the story. Cashore is amazing at crafting <br>
           characters that portray the dichotomy of the human psyche. I read Graceling about 6 months after Fire, and it vividly painted the picture of this enchanting <br>
           world all over again. Our protagonist, Katsa, stirs the thirst for adventure in readers as a young and promising heroine that breaks free from her unfortunate <br>
           circumstances in pursuit of a life she can call her own. Bitterblue, set 8 years after the premises of Graceling, is about a young princess named Bitterblue <br>
           (love the name by the way). Bitterblue who seeks to escape her father, King Leck, whom is beloved by the people as a good ruler but displays his cruel nature <br>
           behind closed doors to Bitterblue and her mother. Princess Bitterblue portrays the thoughts, feelings, and behaviour of a victim of abuse since childhood <br>
           which solidifies her as a character that readers can empathise with and root for. She makes for a relatable protagonist that shows moments of strength as well <br>
           as moments of weakness, which reminds me a little of Mulan (2009). Mulan is a heroine that is revered for her strength and battle prowess but shows moments <br>
           of fragility in the movie, while Bitterblue is a child with many physical and psychological scars that strives to overcome herself. It really drives the point <br>
           that nobody is infallible, but nobody is completely helpless either. Mental fortitude is not a muscle that needs to be trained, but rather comes with a decision. <br>
           Bitterblue was engaging to the very end and I was left wanting more. Amazing storytelling from Cashore that has probably influenced my own style of writing <br>
           as well. Highly underrated series and I would definitely recommend it to those that enjoy fantasy novels. The Graceling series is a story with many layers that <br>
           blend perfectly together in a compelling and exciting manner. I have lent the books to a couple of friends and they both loved it as well. Cashore weaves the story<br>
           skillfully and gracefully, and I hope to see more of her work soon.<br>

    <h3>Gone Series Review</h3>
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dBIwovyAL.jpg" alt="">
    <h4>
        First started reading this while I was bored in camp during National Service. I borrowed this collection from my brother without any prior knowledge of what it<br>
        was about. The Gone Series tells the story of a town where every person aged 15 and above has mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind everyone else trapped <br>
        in an energy dome, ranging from infants to teenagers aged 14. Furthermore, When the 14 year olds turn 15, they will disappear as well. With a group of children <br>
        trapped in the town with no adults, things quickly grow out of control, and factions/groups/cliques are formed, much like in school. The series quickly takes a turn<br>
        for the darker, and gives a realistic portrayal of what would happen if a nuclear fallout happens and leaves behind teenagers and younger. Grant paints a vivid <br>
        picture of the ensuing chaos and struggle for power in this mini-society. This is definitely one of the darker books I have read, with rather graphic details of <br>
        violence and death, not unlike the society we live in now, just on a smaller scale. What I found to be extremely accurate was the portrayal of the children and <br>
        teens/preteens in the series. Grant deserves a lot of credit for bringing to light the mentality and thought processes of the characters, which highlighted that <br>
        children are not stupid, just inexperienced. Therefore, an unfortunate disadvantage of their ability to learn fast is that they are more impressionable to their <br>
        surroundings compared to adults. However, they do have a general sense of morality and telling right from wrong, which many other movies/books/shows fail <br>
        to do justice for. The children are not completely helpless and ignorant, and while mistakes are bound to be made, each of them do have objectives in mind. Grant <br>
        does an extremely good job at pacing the series of events that happen, and each book kept me on the edge of my seat. The protagonist, Sam, is also very relatable,<br>
        having been forced to grow up quickly in this dystopian environment. His immaturity and lack of wisdom shows throughout the series which sealed the deal for me that <br>
        Grant does understand the teenage mind very well. Highly recommend this series to anyone that is looking for something darker from the usual fantasy stuff.
