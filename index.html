    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>My name is Darrell Ng and I am a Singaporean exchange student from National University of Singapore! I am currently in my third year studying Industrial & Systems Engineering.<br>
        I enjoy gaming, reading and writing in my free time. I stay in an airbnb house in Gungahlin during my time here. I am enjoying the relaxing environment of Canberra and ANU, <br>
        and the people here are really friendly compared to back in Singapore. I am very pleased to see the amount of effort that ANU takes to help exchange students have a good stay here <br>
        and feel welcome. I have made many friends here and learnt a lot about Australia. I hope to be able to return for a visit in the future!
    </p>
    
    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>The Grand Library is a website for me to give recommendations and reviews on books that I have read. All the books will be non-fiction, as those are the types that I read the most.<br>
        The genres that I usually read are fantasy, with elements of magic and supernatural stuff, and occasionally thriller and crime as well.<br>
    This website provides my opinions, thoughts and feelings on books, and I would also like to receive recommendations as well! Feel free to give your own recommendations,<br>
    and I am also open to having a discussion as well. I might also including original short stories for critique, if time permits, as writing is also a hobby of mine that I do sporadically.
    </p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To give good book recommendations that others would enjoy</li>
        <li>To write book reviews based on my personal opinion</li>
        <li>To improve in my own writing skills</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        I have learnt that website design is something that is very simple to learn yet difficult to master. The trend of what is appealing to people has moved from flashy colours and patterns<br>
        to simplistic colour schemes with only 3 or 4 colours maximum. Many things have to be taken into consideration, such as colour combination, contrast, content arrangement, font, user <br>
        interactivity, and many more. The complexity of others' preferences and habits is also a factor to be taken into consideration. Additionally, it is also difficult to make the homepage <br>
        appealing enough for others to continue navigating to the rest of the site. The difficulty lies in making it simple enough for people to be able to navigate easily and being attractive<br>
        at glance value, on top of having content that is interesting.
